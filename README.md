Idea taken from CloudlogBashCat, a simple script to keep Cloudlog in synch with rigctld, flri or, fldigi

optimized version for Cloudlog and SparkSDR. It doies not need rigctld started upfront
advantage: rigctld terminates if SparkSDR is not available. This script could be startet @reboot
it waits until SparkSDR is available and pushes the data to Cloudlog
